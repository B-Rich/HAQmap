## Tools in the kit
### HackathonBuilder
This Shiny app creates a push-button solution to creating a "hackathon starter kit."  Your kit will contain:
* a planning calendar containing tasks to be done in advance of your hackathon, based on your desired start date
* a form to accept applications from prospective participants
* a master planning spreadsheet for managing applicants, accepted participants, and teams
* a manuscript template for writing hackathon manuscripts
* and more, coming soon!

When this app is done, you'll be able to log in through Google and your kit will be created for you in a new Google Drive folder.
