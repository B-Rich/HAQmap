**By request: Some people will have projects they want to lead**
Seeking out people that have a project they would like to contribute to in the hackathon environment provides several benefits for the organizer. 
* The topics come with a better-defined scope.
* There is an obvious choice for team lead (this is not necessary however, if a more experienced team lead with relevant background knowledge is available for the project.)
* There will be someone on the team that has a high level of knowledge
**By relevance: How do we define a good problem**
Especially for hackathons designed to introduce people to the process, it is useful to deliberately design projects that do not require prior bioinformatics, programming or software experience. These projects can be flagged as "low-hanging-fruit". Examples include documentation updates, clarifying error messages, copying and modifying tests.
