<p><code>Written by: Peter Oxley</code></p>
<h2 id="11-creating-hackathon-projects">1.1 Creating hackathon projects</h2>
<h4 id="identifying-the-goals-of-the-event">Identifying the goals of the event</h4>
<ul>
<li>development of useful applications, code libraries, databases.</li>
<li>networking and establishment of long-term, inter-disciplinary collaborations.</li>
<li>education of participants in application development process</li>
<li>building teamwork and leadership skills (hackathon process can be adapted for other domains, such as in a laboratory setting (especially in computer science), where postdocs become team lead for a week-long hackathon in lab, with the lead rotating through all postdocs in the lab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By request: Some people will have projects they want to lead</strong>
Seeking out people that have a project they would like to contribute to in the hackathon environment provides several benefits for the organizer. </p>
<ul>
<li>The topics come with a better-defined scope.</li>
<li>There is an obvious choice for team lead (this is not necessary however, if a more experienced team lead with relevant background knowledge is available for the project.)</li>
<li><p>There will be someone on the team that has a high level of knowledge</p>
</li>
<li><p>Questions to ask to develop a project (and to help identify potential participants):</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Description<ul>
<li>What need will your project fulfill? </li>
<li>What do you want its functionality to be?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General Project Goals <ul>
<li>What do you want the end product to be? </li>
<li>how do you want to get there?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team skills<ul>
<li>What are your strengths?</li>
<li>What types of skills might you rely on your team members for?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resources<ul>
<li>Atypical software the project will require.</li>
<li>Compute resources required: RAM, disk space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By relevance: How do we define a good problem</strong>
Especially for hackathons designed to introduce people to the process, it is useful to deliberately design projects that do not require prior bioinformatics, programming or software experience. These projects can be flagged as &quot;low-hanging-fruit&quot;. Examples include documentation updates, clarifying error messages, copying and modifying tests.</p>
<h2 id="12-gathering-participants">1.2 Gathering participants</h2>
<h4 id="advertising">Advertising</h4>
<p>Reaching all the relevant people. How early should the advertising begin?</p>
<ul>
<li>blogs</li>
<li>social media (Twitter, facebook, etc)<ul>
<li>identify social groups to target announcements to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conferences</li>
<li>project lists, listservs</li>
<li>web page<ul>
<li>NCBI hackathon has a specific web page to list all confirmed hackathon events</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Forms: Data to collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>questions from June Hackathon&apos;s form<ul>
<li>Do you have a working knowledge of shell scripting?</li>
<li>What other programming languages do you have experience with?</li>
<li>What is the primary research question you work on?</li>
<li>Are you interested in working on a similar problem during this workshop?</li>
<li>Please tell us in 3-4 sentences why you want to participate.</li>

<ul>
<li>adding all communication to the github page, ensuring that all users have an account set up.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filtering">Filtering</h4>
<ul>
<li>Criteria<ul>
<li>basic knowledge of command line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Number of participants - factor in a 10% drop-out rate when creating inclusion list<ul>
<li>Create an A, B and C list, so that when an individual drops out of the event, there is a shortlist ready to bring in a replacement quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Required knowledge - depends on the topic. <ul>
<li>coding language</li>
<li>software knowledge</li>
<li>research domain knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>team leads could be involved in this process?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identifying team leads. These people will organize, delegate and ensure effective communication among team members. The following attributes will frequently indicate a good choice for team lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>author of project proposal</li>
<li>prior experience leading hackathon teams</li>
<li>prior hackathon participation</li>
<li>domain expertise (software, coding or scientific)</li>

<h1 id="2-running-the-hackathon">2. Running the hackathon</h1>
<p>The majority of projects will cease to be developed at the end of the Hackathon. Therefore, it is paramount that by the end of the event, the code is deposited in a public repository, developed to a useable degree, and well documented. </p>
<h2 id="21-coordinating-the-event-aka-maintaining-momentum">2.1 Coordinating the event (aka maintaining momentum)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeping enthusiasm high is key. Once a team loses motivation, productivity will plummet. If people leave (for negative inter-personal reasons), it will be disastrous for team morale and productivity. </li>
<li>Event coordinator must identify team communication blocks early, and have the ability to diffuse tension and facilitate problem solving.</li>
<li>The coordinator will not have the capacity to become deeply involved in the development or troubleshooting of any given project. They will not likely do any but the most cursory of coding.</li>
<li>Coordinator should be aware of their audience, and the expected etiquette for interaction (eg, appropriate dress code for coordinator - typically slightly more formal than the average expected participant).</li>
<li>Will need to keep track of who may decide to leave, and identify the issue that caused the participant to make this decision. It is then the coordinator&apos;s responsibility to ensure that the issue is addressed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="22-documentation">2.2 Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation allows code to be understood, installed and used, debugged and error checked, and extended. Without documentation, an application is unlikely to become utilized by the research community. However, documentation is frequently a low priority of development teams. It is therefore important for the event manager/coordinator to build into the program education about the importance of documenting things, education of people in how to document, and sessions to inspect the current level of documentation, and to provide correction.</p>
<p>Elements that need to be documented include: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 sentence description/summary of the project</li>
<li>implementation button - get to the application obviously and easily</li>
<li><p>link toc to all elements</p>
</li>
<li><p>description</p>
</li>
<li>background</li>
<li>Code link</li>
<li>Package dependencies</li>
<li>Installation instructions/implementation</li>
<li>Usage instructions</li>
<li>Data formats and standards applied</li>
<li>lots of images of results</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assign-document-writers-in-each-team">Assign document writers in each team</h4>
<p>Each team designates a writer to ensure documentation is captured and published.</p>
<h4 id="tracking-documentation-progress">Tracking documentation progress</h4>
<p>Implement writer breakout sessions to ensure documentation is on track, following appropriate standards, troubleshoot any issues.</p>

<h2 id="23-meal-breaks">2.3 Meal breaks</h2>
<p>Maintaining hydration and blood sugar levels is important for focus and productivity. Thus it is important to stress to participants the need to take breaks and eat and drink. This will be more likely adhered to if nutrition is easily available and/or free.</p>

<h2 id="34-handing-on-the-baton">3.4 Handing on the baton</h2>
<p>This section deals with how to ensure that the code can continue to be built, tested, improved and extended. This process begins during the final hours of the hackathon, and is in some respects never finished. But there are certain milestones that can be set in terms of finalizing the effort begun during the day(s) of the hackathon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assigning who is responsible for administering pull requests, and reported issues.</li>
<li>Finishing testing and debugging with sample datasets</li>
<li>Publishing the package in an open-science, peer-reviewed journal (eg. F1000)</li>
<li>Handing over or leading extension at the next hackathon</li>
</ol>
