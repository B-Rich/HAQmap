Breakfast 
        
Find someone to sponsor coffee and donuts or bagels. This will engage stakeholders  
        
Considerations for the working lunch:


Buying as a group 
        
Assign a point person for coordinating food purchases from a local vendor and coordinating payment with participants. Consider using a payment app so people can pay with their credit cards.


Provide food to participants in a common room where there is a projector for sharing of progress and discussion between groups 


Buying as an individual
Give people a heads up ahead of time that they will have to go out for their food and provide some options you know make sense for your location.
